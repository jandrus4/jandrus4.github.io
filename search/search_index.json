A small voltage anywhere from -0.5 volts to +0.5 volts will be generated. This range corresponds to the pH of the water, where the more acidic pH will generate a larger negative voltage and the more basic pH will generate a larger positive voltage.</p> <p>The signal is amplified by the operational amplifier which has an ideal gain equal to 4. The microcontroller take this analog signal, convert it to digital and then make a decision as to whether the pH is safe or not. After making the decision, either the green or red LED will light up to indicate \"SAFE\" or 'DANGER\", respectively. The decision and pH value will also be sent to the control board where they will be displayed on the device's screen.</p> <p>There is also a debugging button which allows the PCB to enter and exit \"Testing Mode\", as well as 2 yellow LEDs for debugging indications.</p> <p>If there are any power issues, the header pins also provide power connections to either supply or receive 5 volts and a ground connection for the other PCBs.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#block-diagram","title":"Block Diagram","text":"<p>Figure 1 displays the pH Sensor Block Diagram.

The device doesn't need more than 1 operational amplifier and since all 3 choices are roughly the same price, the choice became clear.</p> <p>pH Probe</p> <ol> <li> <p>ENV-30-PH CONSUMER GRADE PH PROBE</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$49.99/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Inexpensive component Additional $15 shipping fee Short shipping time Range of 2-13 Accurate to + or - 0.1 pH Can never be dry </li> <li> <p>ENV-45-PH SPEAR TIP PH PROBE</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$169.99/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Reads from 0-14 pH Extremely expensive Life expectancy of 2.5+ years Most likely will require monthly recalibration Max pressure of 100 psi <ol> <li>ENV-40-PH LAB GRADE PH PROBE</li> </ol> <p></p> <ul> <li>$84.99/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Accurate to + or - 0.002 pH Very expensive Much stronger output current Most likely will require monthly recalibration Hydrogen amplification leads to less noise and more stable readings </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 1: ENV-30-PH</p> <p>Rationale: Since this device will primarily be used to tell consumers if their water is safe to drink or not, they will not need super accurate pH readings. While the ENV-40-PH and ENV-45-PH are clearly higher quality, their higher costs make the ENV-30-PH the clear choice.</p> <p>Coaxial Connector</p> <ol> <li> <p>RF2-04A-T-00-50-G CONN SMA JACK STR 50 OHM PCB</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$1.70/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Inexpensive component Long shipping time Meets through hole mount project constraint Lower max frequency </li> <li> <p>RFPC-SMA28-F SMA VERTICAL PCB JACK</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$1.73/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Inexpensive component Lower max frequency Meets through hole mount project constraint 50 ohm impedance Shorter shipping time <ol> <li>SMA-J-P-H-ST-TH1 CONN SMA JACK STR 50 OHM PCB</li> </ol> <p></p> <ul> <li>$2.67/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Higher max frequency Slightly more expensive Larger operating temperature range Fewer threads to fasten to Shortest shipping time </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 3: SMA-J-P-H-ST-TH1</p> <p>Rationale: Coaxial connectors aren't very different from each other and while the device probably won't come close to 20 GHz, it's nice to have better electrical ratings. This connector is slightly more expensive, but by less than a dollar compared to the other connectors. It will also arrive the fastest compared to the others.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>The following table is a list of the materials used in this subsystem and the total cost.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"<p>Table 1: pH Sensor Bill of Materials</p> Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacture Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 8-bit SIPO/SISO Shift Register, SOIC-16 package 1 $0.49 $ 0.49 NXP 74HC595D,112 DigiKey datasheet link U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, 50V 6 n/a n/a n/a n/a PRLTA 109 n/a C1, C2 Debug LED (yellow) 8 n/a n/a n/a n/a PRLTA 109 n/a D3, D4, D5, D6 SAFE and DANGER LEDs (green and red) 3 n/a n/a n/a n/a PRLTA 109 n/a D1, D2 3.5 Amp fuse, 5 V 4 n/a n/a n/a n/a PRLTA 109 n/a F1 Test Point 24 n/a n/a n/a n/a PRLTA 109 n/a T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10, T11, T12 Pushbutton (Debug switch) 3 n/a n/a n/a n/a PRLTA 109 n/a SW1 10K ohm resistor, 0.25W 2 n/a n/a n/a n/a PRLTA 109 n/a R1 220 ohm resistor 4 n/a n/a n/a n/a PRLTA 109 n/a R2, R4 5K ohm resistor 4 n/a n/a n/a n/a PRLTA 109 n/a R5, R6 15K ohm resistor 2 n/a n/a n/a n/a PRLTA 109 n/a R7 <p>Note: Setting it up as a table is nice because it is completely viewable without scaling issues.
