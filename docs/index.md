## Introduction

* Team 210 of the Fall 2025 EGR 304 class has worked for months to design and prototype a new, high-quality, inexpensive water quality analyzer. As a member of Team 210, I was tasked with designing a subsystem of the device to measure the pH of any body of water the consumer might encounter. This individual datasheet will walk you through how Mr. Andrus designed and built the pH subsystem.

### Project Summary

* This needs to be updated to reflect <ins>your version</ins> of the team project, so when shared not via the team's report, the reader gets an idea of the direction of the project and how your work will contribute to the overall success.
* Add context that ties into the link to your [team report.](https://egr304-2025-f-210.github.io/)
