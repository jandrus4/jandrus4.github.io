## Introduction

Team 210 of the Fall 2025 EGR 304 class has worked for months to design and prototype a new, high-quality, inexpensive water quality analyzer. As a member of Team 210, Jacob was tasked with designing a subsystem of the device to measure the pH of any body of water the consumer might encounter. This individual datasheet will walk you through how he designed and built the pH subsystem.

### Project Summary

WaterVibe has decided to design and construct a low-cost and efficient water quality analyzer and after recognizing pH, opacity and conductivity as some of the most important qualities, every team member was tasked with designing 1 of 4 subsystems for the device.

As the one tasked with designing and building the pH sensor, Jacob did extensive research, drew circuits in KiCad and tested several electronic components to make an efficient subsystem.

To review the details listed of the material used to construct the subsection, which is still being put together, you can review it in the ["BOM"](https://jandrus4.github.io/03-BOM/BOM/) section of the datasheet.

### My Contribution

* Project Monitor: Responsible for keeping the team on track with all of its work
* Electrical expert: Due to his 6 years in the US Navy as an Electrician's Mate, Nuclear, Jacob was responsible for ensuring all team members' circuits were designed with safety being the #1 priority
* pH Subsystem: Created the design for the pH sensor from scratch
