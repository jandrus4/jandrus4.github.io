I would improve my design by ordering my parts a lot sooner and finding better datasheets for weird parts. The pH probe I ordered for my subsystem did not work with my design, and the datasheet did not do a good job of explaining how THAT specific model worked. The datasheet only explained how that company's series of pH probes theoretically worked, but didn't explain any of the constant values or what values to expect when measuring pH.

I would also prefer to space the components out a little more on my PCB so that it would be easier to solder everything onto the board.

**Lessons Learned:**
The most important thing I learned was to hit the ground running and ask lots of questions because there will be lots of things that will be confusing. The teachers are there to help, so use them as much as possible.
