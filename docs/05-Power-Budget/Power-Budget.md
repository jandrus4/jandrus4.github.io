title: Power Budget
---

## Overview
The only components that need a power supply are the microcontroller and operational amplifier. The voltage regulator will take the 9 volts from the battery and regulate it to 5 volts. All other electronic signals will be processed by the microcontroller and used to indicate safe or dangerous pH levels of water.

## Conclusions

The power budget shows significant available power, due to the fact that not many components require some kind of external power source. VibeWater intends to use this subsystem's power supply as a backup in the event their power systems fail.
